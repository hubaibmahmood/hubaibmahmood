# Hi, I'm Hubaib Mehmood 👋

### I Build Production-Ready AI SaaS for Non-Technical Founders

Most developers build what you ask for. I build what you actually need — **Spec-First methodology** that eliminates scope creep, prevents technical debt, and ships production-ready platforms.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in three core areas:

### 🔧 n8n Workflow Automation
Eliminate repetitive tasks and streamline operations with intelligent workflows that connect your CRM, email, databases, and APIs.

**Use Cases:**
- Lead processing & automated follow-ups
- Data synchronization between apps
- Trigger-based notifications and business process automation
- Multi-step workflows that save hours of manual work

### 🤖 AI-Driven Development
Build intelligent systems with multi-agent workflows, custom AI logic, and predictive tools tailored to your business needs.

**Use Cases:**
- Conversational bots & AI assistants
- Predictive analytics & decision-support systems
- AI-powered internal tools & custom workflows
- Agent orchestration and intelligent automation

### 📋 Spec-Driven Development (Spec-Kit-Plus)
A structured, specification-first methodology where the spec becomes the foundation of your system—not just documentation, but a living, executable artifact that drives development.

**Why It Matters:**
- ✅ **Clarity & Alignment:** Get exactly what you envisioned
- ✅ **Predictability:** Minimize surprises and rework
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Spec becomes your reference point
- ✅ **High Quality:** Built-in validation ensures reliability

## 📈 My Development Process

I follow a **transparent, structured process** from discovery to delivery:

1. **Discovery** - Discuss goals, pain points, and vision
2. **Specification** - Create detailed spec outlining system behavior and workflows
3. **Technical Planning** - Design architecture and roadmap
4. **Task Breakdown** - Break plan into actionable, testable tasks
5. **Implementation** - Build system aligned with specification
6. **Validation & Delivery** - Validate against spec, deliver with full documentation

Every project gets complete visibility at every stage.
